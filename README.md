## Two Main Rules

1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.

I decided challenge myself to learn a new programming language and framework. I've chosen Ruby on Rails because i have some friends with a great feedback, the syntax caught my eye, it has a large community and used by many companies.

```ruby
puts "Don't be discouraged."
```
`Got a job in a ruby role! =D`
