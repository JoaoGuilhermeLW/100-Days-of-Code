# 100 Days Of Code - Ruby on Rails

### Day 01: June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installed Ruby and readed the guide from documentation. Also, i did a introduction into numbers, letters and printing.

**Thoughts:** I think it will be a hard, arduous and pleasant journey. I hope to continue with focus, responsability and struggling everyday for my personal evolution. Ruby sounds sweety =)

### Day 02: June 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I played with variables, numbers, some string methods, conditional statements and flux control. I did a lot of exercises too.

**Thoughts:** Today i had a lot of free time so i could spend it diving into Ruby. It was very interesting due to fact that the more i read, the more i wanted more =O

### Day 03: June 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: As yesterday, i had a lot of free time today so i spent almost the entire day studying Ruby. I learned more about methods, played with classes on Ruby and its vars, hashs, blocs, procs and practiced answering exercises.

**Thoughts:** Well, i think i was right. Ruby is sweety. I'm impress how fast i like this language. Even the "hard" things to understand i got it quickly due to the syntax and how i feel good when i'm into coding. What agony delight shall we inflict? --Thresh
