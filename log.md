# 100 Days Of Code - Ruby on Rails

### Day 0: June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installed Ruby and readed the guide from documentation.

**Thoughts:** I think its gonna be a hard and pleasure journey. I hope to continue with focus, responsability and struggling everyday for my personal evolution.
