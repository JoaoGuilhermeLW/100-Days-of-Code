# 100 Days Of Code - Ruby on Rails

### Day 01: June 21, 2021

``Today's Progress:`` Installed Ruby and readed the guide from documentation. Also, i did a introduction into numbers, letters and printing.

``Thoughts:`` I think it will be a hard, arduous and pleasant journey. I hope to continue with focus, responsability and struggling everyday for my personal evolution. Ruby sounds sweety =)

### Day 02: June 22, 2021

``Today's Progress``: I played with variables, numbers, some string methods, conditional statements and flux control. I did a lot of exercises too.

``Thoughts:`` Today i had a lot of free time so i could spend it diving into Ruby. It was very interesting due to fact that the more i read, the more i wanted more =O

### Day 03: June 23, 2021

``Today's Progress:`` As yesterday, i had a lot of free time today so i spent almost the entire day studying Ruby. I learned more about methods, played with classes on Ruby and its vars, hashs and practiced answering exercises.

``Thoughts:`` Well, i think i was right. Ruby is sweety. I'm impress how fast i like this language. Even the "hard" things to understand i got it quickly due to the syntax and how i feel good when i'm into coding. What agony delight shall we inflict? --Thresh

### Day 04: June 24, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I learned about procs (interesting feature btw), blocs and how to handle files in Ruby. I did some exercises to pratice.

`Thoughts:` It's coming... I already started racking my brain with this exercises. I know i know, no pain no gain. So, let's keep going.

### Day 05: June 25, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I readed and understood about how to manipulate CSV files. I made a program to read a phone contact list csv and print the informations pretty.

`Thoughts`: Nothing special, it's fine. I like the fact there are many libraries to help handle csv files.

### Day 06: June 26, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I did a phone scraper. As a headset lover, i decided to learn about some Ruby libraries and made a program to scrap my favorite website headset shop for phone informations (name and price) and save it to me.

`Thoughts`: I needed a litle more of struggle on resolve some errors and execption, i got lost, readed tutorials, came back to life and its finally worked. 

### Day 07 June 27, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I kept working on the phone scraper, because the website that i was scraping implemented some features to avoid scrapers scripts to scrap. In this case, the div.class name was "jss" plus a random number for each request. So, i had to think how to bypass it. I'm updating my code to do a regex search through jss+regex and verify if the .text contains the string "R$" to retreive the price. Also, i started to read about database and how to implement with sqlite3. I think i will build a bank account system to transfer money between accounts, like pix in the next days.

`Thoughts`: Using Ruby as a wrench for daily programming is softy and fun. I'm liking it.
