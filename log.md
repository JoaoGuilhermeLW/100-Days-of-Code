# 100 Days Of Code - Ruby on Rails

### Day 01: June 21, 2021

``Today's Progress:`` Installed Ruby and readed the guide from documentation. Also, i did a introduction into numbers, letters and printing.

``Thoughts:`` I think it will be a hard, arduous and pleasant journey. I hope to continue with focus, responsability and struggling everyday for my personal evolution. Ruby sounds sweety =)

### Day 02: June 22, 2021

``Today's Progress``: I played with variables, numbers, some string methods, conditional statements and flux control. I did a lot of exercises too.

``Thoughts:`` Today i had a lot of free time so i could spend it diving into Ruby. It was very interesting due to fact that the more i read, the more i wanted more =O

### Day 03: June 23, 2021

``Today's Progress:`` As yesterday, i had a lot of free time today so i spent almost the entire day studying Ruby. I learned more about methods, played with classes on Ruby and its vars, hashs and practiced answering exercises.

``Thoughts:`` Well, i think i was right. Ruby is sweety. I'm impress how fast i like this language. Even the "hard" things to understand i got it quickly due to the syntax and how i feel good when i'm into coding. What agony delight shall we inflict? --Thresh

### Day 04: June 24, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I learned about procs (interesting feature btw), blocs and how to handle files in Ruby. I did some exercises to pratice.

`Thoughts:` It's coming... I already started racking my brain with this exercises. I know i know, no pain no gain. So, let's keep going.

### Day 05: June 25, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I readed and understood about how to manipulate CSV files. I made a program to read a phone contact list csv and print the informations pretty.

`Thoughts`: Nothing special, it's fine. I like the fact there are many libraries to help handle csv files.

### Day 06: June 26, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I did a phone scraper. As a headset lover, i decided to learn about some Ruby libraries and made a program to scrap my favorite website headset shop for phone informations (name and price) and save it to me.

`Thoughts`: I needed a litle more of struggle on resolve some errors and execption, i got lost, readed tutorials, came back to life and its finally worked. 

### Day 07 June 27, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I kept working on the phone scraper, because the website that i was scraping implemented some features to avoid scrapers scripts to scrap. In this case, the div.class name was "jss" plus a random number for each request. So, i had to think how to bypass it. I'm updating my code to do a regex search through jss+regex and verify if the .text contains the string "R$" to retreive the price. Also, i started to read about database and how to implement with sqlite3. I think i will build a bank account system to transfer money between accounts, like pix in the next days.

`Thoughts`: Using Ruby as a wrench for daily programming is softy and fun. I'm liking it.

### Day 08 June 28, 2021

`Today's Progress`: i learned more about how to implement database in Ruby, creating new databases with sqlite3 framework and fetching some data. I started to code a bank account system.

`Thoughts`: A friendly syntax to deal with.

### Day 09 June 29, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I continued to implement the bank system, adding classes and methods.

`Thoughts`: I wish i had more time to dive completely in Ruby study, but university is cutting my head off.

### Day 16 July 06, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I readed about semantic and also readed a lot of code to learn new things.

`Thoughts`: Keep studying.

### Day 17 July 07, 2021

`Today's Progress`: A friend of mine sent me a link to best practices in Ruby. So I started reading (it's pretty big lol)! It contains several topics about programming (of course), full of tricks and tips. I learned about two Ruby operators very interesting: &&= and ||=.

`Thoughts`: Now i'm sure that is impossible to know everything about a language haha

### Day 18 July 08, 2021

`Today's Progress`: Today was my first day as intern in a software development company. I did the Advent of Code's first challenge in Ruby!

`Thoughts`: i'm so exciting with everything. I can't wait to start Rails and get deeper.

### Day 19 July 09, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I've done some exercises to pratice code. I did another Advent of Code's challenge and readed about Duck Typing and Syntactic Sugar in Ruby.

`Thoughts`: Nice, cool, very nice.

### Day 20 July 10, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I readed a little bit about Web in Ruby.

`Thoughts`: Just adding knowledge.

### Day 21 July 12, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I built a big Ruby guide with the mainly topics summarized until now and tomorrow i will start Rails. Let the chaos begin.

`Thoughts`: More knowledgment, please.

### Day 22 July 13, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I just started the introduction to Rails. Too much university work

`Thoughts`: Moving on.

### Day 23 July 14, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I already installed Rails and started demo server to interact with. Also readed about metaprogramming in Ruby.

`Thoughts`: Easier to install than Django =P

### Day 24 July 15, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I forgot to push my daily report to git, because it was a big day. I refactored my Advent of Code's day 1 code with my company team. Learned new things like the operator &:. Also, readed more about Rails.

`Thoughts`: Tired and glad.

### Day 25 July 16, 2021

`Today's Progress`: My last day doing university works (finally!). I readed few topics about Ruby just to stay connect and do not lose touch.

`Thoughts`: Looking forward to spending the day studying ruby.

### Day 26 July 17, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I readed a very begging introduction about MVC framework in Rails.

`Thoughts`: Fly me to the moon, let me play among the stars.

### Day 27 July 18, 2021

`Today's Progress`: ActiveRecord provides a range of programming techniques and shortcuts for manipulating data from an SQL database. ActionController and ActionView provides facilities for manipulating and displaying that data. Rails ties it all together.

`Thoughts`: This part is similar to Django. Same principle.

### Day 28 July 19, 2021

`Today's Progress`: What i've learned today:
*  The controllers subdirectory is where Rails looks to find controller classes. A controller handles a web request from the user.

* The views subdirectory holds the display templates to fill in with data from our application, convert to HTML, and return to the user's browser.

* The models subdirectory holds the classes that model and wrap the data stored in our application's database. In most frameworks, this part of the application can grow pretty messy, tedious, verbose, and error-prone. Rails makes it dead simple.

* The helpers subdirectory holds any helper classes used to assist the model, view, and controller classes. This helps to keep the model, view, and controller code small, focused, and uncluttered.

`Thoughts`: Similar to Django with few differences.

### Day 29 July 22, 2021

`Today's Progress`: Learned about models validation in Rails, installed Postgresql and configure it.

`Thoughts`: New world is open.

### Day 30 July 23, 2021

`Today's Progress`: A nice day full of knowledge. I built my Rails application, coded the models, controllers and views files for my library system haha. Learned about ERB and how the flow works.

`Thoughts`: Hard but satisfy.

### Day 31 July 25, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I stylized my library view with some css. Learned few things like linked tags and how to standard a piece of the page.

`Thoughts`: Nil.

### Day 32 July 26, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I made a new Rails application called blog. I builded some routes, controllers, models and views. Learned some methods like "link_to".

`Thoughts`: Rails helps a lot.

### Day 33 July 27, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I don't even know where to start. Well, today was a full day of learning. I coded the advent of code challenge 2 and my partners helped me to refact it. Learned hwo to use map and regex, &: operator to resume a block of code. Also, coded the create article func of my Rails application and learned about forms and some others functions that Rails implements to help and save writing.

`Thoughts`: Ruby is a language that really implements sugar syntax.

### Day 34 July 28, 2021

`Today's Progress`: Today i finished my Rails application! I implemented and learned about authentication, concerns, forms, refactored views rendering templates, status, etc. A big day of knowledge.

`Thoughts`: Rails helps a lot simplifing and save a lot of code.

### Day 35 July 29, 2021

`Today's Progress`: I coded the Advent of Code day 3 in Ruby. Tried to use the max numbers of OOP and Functional program concepts.

`Thoughts`: I got stucked in the earlier, so was kind of difficult.
