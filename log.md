# 100 Days Of Code - Ruby on Rails

### Day 0: June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installed Ruby and readed the guide from documentation. Also, i did a introduction into numbers, letters and printing.

**Thoughts:** I think it's gonna be a hard and pleasure journey. I hope to continue with focus, responsability and struggling everyday for my personal evolution. Ruby sounds sweety =)
